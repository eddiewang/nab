## NABP (Not Another Boilerplate) - My Personal Boilerplate for React

###Technology Stack:
React
MobX
NodeJS
Express

###Why use this boilerplate:
- Dead simple architecture
- Easy to understand for beginners and intermediates looking to learn best practices
- Opiniated, but very barebones

##Credits:
This boilerplate borrows heavily from boilers I've previously contributed to, or worked with. Shoutout to react-boilerplate, Frontend Masters, and egghead for the useful resources!
