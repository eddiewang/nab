## NAB (Not Another Boilerplate) - My Personal Boilerplate for React

> This is still in **development**.
Feel free to look at the code, but I wouldn't recommend it for production use.

###Main Technology Stack:
- React
- MobX
- NodeJS
- Express

##Install:
Make sure you have Yarn installed.
Open terminal and cd into the working dictionary then type:
`yarn`

###Why use this boilerplate:
- Dead simple architecture
- Easy to understand for beginners and intermediates looking to learn best practices
- Opiniated, but very barebones

##Credits:
This boilerplate borrows heavily from boilerplates I've previously contributed to, or worked with. Shoutout to react-boilerplate, Frontend Masters, and egghead for the useful resources!
